----To Do List----

1. Page layout could use better styling when browser is resized

2. Sorting players by yc/rc does not work properly since they are from the same table but seperated into different columns

3. Create a league table

4. Default fixture to current season with a list of future games, would probably work to just create the match as empty with no gf or ga.
Should not count towards all time record.

5. Add "IsCurrentSeason" flag to season table
